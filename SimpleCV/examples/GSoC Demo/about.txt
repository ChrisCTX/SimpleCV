This is my sample / demo for my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) application

The program is split into two parts, one has a sample of the overall idea I want to develop 
and the other uses the first part to get the angle between a point where movement happened 
and the center of the image.

I include 5 images to use as tests with virtual cameras, it's just a matter of changing the 
file name and adding a new Region of Interest (ROI) that fits the area of the image that changes.
